<!-- Code Block
  Code block elements are used to wrap program fragments in C++. The
  element is partially formatted for improved rendering by removing
  leading and trailing whitespace that is generally annoying in
  <pre> blocks.

  Also, without this, <pre> block was being rendered outside of examples.
  That's not desirable.

  TODO: This could call into a syntax highlighter that styles
  comments correctly.
